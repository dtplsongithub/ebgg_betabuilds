How to make my own backgrounds?

STEP 1

create a .deb file in /data
in it, write:

---start of file
name of background
pallete colors, without #, separated by ","
once every how many frames does the pallete cycle
does the pallete cycle? (0/1)
does the pallete cycle in reverse? (0/1)
dont cycle the nth items
camera velocity x
camera velocity y
[PTM] separated by , no need for {} dont put a , at the end
-ptmend <- neccesary
scale
x wavyness scale
x wavyness frequency
interleaved wavyness? (0/1)
y wavyness scale
y wavyness frequency
x static scale
---end of file

STEP 2

there is no step 2
the file is automatically detected by the program and added in the background list :)

if there are any problems carefully read your file or contact me at
