earthbound background generator (processing editionâ„¢)
<br><br>
### What's this? <br>
a silly little program in which you can make earthbound-styled backgrounds <br>
<br>
### How to make my own background? <br>
/bghelp.txt<br>
follow the instructions and then it should work<br>
if there are any bugs, please make an issue about it, thanks <br>
I am currently working on an editor, so bghelp might become obsolete in a few days (or weeks... depending on how productive i am).
### Read this before downloading!
This program was made in [Processing 4](https://processing.org/), so it needs [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/) for it to work*. <br>
*(ignore this if you want to get the OpenJDK-included version!)
